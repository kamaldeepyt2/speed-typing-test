# speed-typing-test

In this Python project idea, we'll create an amazing project that will allow you to test and improve your typing speed. We'll utilize the pygame library, which is used to interact with graphics, to create a graphical user interface. The graphics and text that will be shown on the screen will be drawn.

# Prerequisites
The Python project needs a basic understanding of Python programming and the Pygame module. In your terminal, enter the following code to install the pygame library.
pip install pygame

# Files
Let's have a look at the file structure of the Python project with source code that we'll be creating:
backdrop.jpg — This is the picture that will be used as a background in our software.
icon.png — This is the icon that will be used as a reset button.
sentences.txt - A list of sentences will be separated by a new line in this text file.
type-speed-open.png – This is the picture that will appear when you first start the game.

To begin, we produced the sentences.txt file, which has various lines separated by a new line.
